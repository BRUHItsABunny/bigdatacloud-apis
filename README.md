# BigDataCloud API's
Big data cloud API's  in Golang

### How to use this library
First use the following command:

``go get github.com/BRUHItsABunny/bigdatacloud-apis``

Then get your API key from [here](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/) and just feed it into the `NewBigDataCloudClient()` function

Refer to [lib_test.go](https://github.com/BRUHItsABunny/bigdatacloud-apis/blob/main/lib_test.go) to see how to use the library

To run the tests make a new file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and copy the contents of `test.env` to it. Modify it as needed.

### TODO
* Add the other API calls
